# Tic-Tac-Toe-Web-Application
ðŸŽ¯ Task-03: Tic-Tac-Toe Web App As part of my web development internship at Prodigy Infotech, I built a fun and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports both player-vs-player and player-vs-AI modes. This project helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation and game logic! ðŸ§©ðŸ’¡
